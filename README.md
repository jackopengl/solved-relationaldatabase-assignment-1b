You have created a table of your choice with relevant fields. Now you want to retrieve useful information from this table. Add relevant SELECT statements at the end of the Assignment 1a, <strong>clearly commenting the functionality of each of them</strong>. Think of what type of queries will be made on the table data in a real life scenario and come up with associated SELECT statements for them. You can insert more relevant records in the table if you require doing so.

I want to see at least 15 SELECT statements, satisfying the criterion given below. A statement can include one or more than one criteria.

 <li>An exact match involving character data â€“ recollect does not involve wildcard characters, like % and _</li>

 <li>Use of NOT LIKE comparison operator, for an inexact match, using wildcard character %</li>
